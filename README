Project name: Seekify, by Sophia Cardona Nader, Estefania Griffiths, and Haylee Zuba
This project is intended to mitigate the barrier between Spotify users and finding new music. Listening to the same old songs can be frustrating.
Seekify aims to create an ease of access song finder based on song similarity.

About this project
This project is accomplished by utilizing graphs to store the song data, giving each song a weight using a similarity metric, then using Djikstra's algorithm to find the path with least weight from one song to the next.
